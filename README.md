# Homebrew AVTools

A brew tap for assorted audio and video tools in use at SVT, mainly for encoding purposes.

Currently this tap holds minor modifications of existing core Homebrew formulas  - FFmpeg and codecs, but also formulas for a few of the [FFmpeg filters released by SVT](https://github.com/svt/ffmpeg-filter-proxy)

* ffmpeg-encore - FFmpeg tailored for encore, with x264, x265, [ffmpg-filter-proxy support](https://github.com/svt/ffmpeg-filter-proxy)
* libsrf-proxy-filter -  [Subtitle Rendering Format filter](https://github.com/svt/ffmpeg-filter-proxy-filters)
* libsvg-proxy-filter - [SVG filter](https://github.com/svt/ffmpeg-filter-proxy-filters)
* x264-encore - [x264 encoder lib](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/x264.git)
* x265-encore - [x265 encoder lib](https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265_git)


## Dependencies

- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)

## Installation & Usage

There are a few options. 

You can use the pre-built Docker Image, build your own Docker Image from the Dockerfile, or add the Brew tap and build it on your machine.


### Install Brew tap

- Add the tap to your Brew tap configuration, and install the tools you wish

```console
$ brew tap svt/avtools 
```

- Optional: For more info about the tap you could use (example uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

```console
$ brew tap-info svt/avtools --json | jq
```

- Example install

```console
$ brew install ffmpeg-encore
```

### With Docker

#### Test the pre-built Docker Image

_**This image is only intended for development and certainly not for production usage. It contains the taps version of the avtools formulas, and a few other apps like mediainfo.
Notably, compared to the Formula/ffmpeg-encore does *excludes* the GPL-incompatible library fdk-aac** (but use aac instedI)_

[avtools-osadl-debian](https://github.com/svt?tab=packages&repo_name=homebrew-avtools), 


#### Building your own Dockerimage


You can also build you own Docker Image using the included Dockerfile. 

Use of [Docker buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) is assumed

_Example, located in the project root, using buildx, building the distribution image for the linux/amd64 platform, without the fdk-aac library_

```console
$ docker build --target=distribution --platform linux/amd64 --build-arg=FFMPEG_BREW_OPTIONS=--without-fdk-aac . -f docker/Dockerfile.osadl.debian
```

Available build targets are:

* buildimage
* distribution
* source

Default: If you dont give a --target you will build the distribution image as default - but also all other targets, so set the target, you want to avoid the source target if you don't need it.

Brew Options through the Docker build:

* To build the FFmepg forumla without fdk-aac you could pass the --build-arg FFMPEG_BREW_OPTIONS=--without-fdk-aac


**NOTE: If you build your own Docker Image for anything else than internal use, you have to consider how the third party dependencies interact, if you want to avoid building an un-distributable image.
A notable example is that you can't include the fdk-aac library together with x264,x265 in the same build, as the fdk-aac license is currently GPL-incompatible.**

## Configuration

Currently, the configurations options are few - this might change in the future.

## Known issues

* The Docker Images could be smaller if it used Alpine, and was optimized regarding dependencies

* The build uses some libraries installed through apt, so we are *not* in the Brew eco system totally - in other words, all dependecies used for the avvideo tools are not found in Brew repos, most notably glibc. Run ffmpeg with ldd to see a list.
 
* Auditing the Formulas still gives a few warnings, *feel free to fix them.*
To audit them all, from the project's root folder you can run

```console
$ for f in Formula/*.rb; do echo "Processing $f file.."; eval "brew audit --new --formula $f"; done
```

* The Formulas is not yet keg_only, which could allow to have multiple instances/versions

### NOTE ABOUT THE FFMPEG FORMULA BUILD BINARY RESULTS

The binaries the Formulas will *build* is released under various other licenses, depending on your build options. 
See the different projects homepages and the license metadata in the docker/misc/LICENSE_THIRD_PARTIES.txt for some guidance to make an informed decision if you intend to distribute any built binaries further. 

### PRE-BUILT DOCKER IMAGE LICENSE

The Docker Image avtools-osadl-debian image is built on the [OSADL](https://www.osadl.org/OSADL-Docker-Base-Image.osadl-docker-base-image.0.html ) Debian base image.
